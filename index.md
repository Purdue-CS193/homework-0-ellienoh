# Ellie Noh's First CS193 Homework

## CS193 Related Stuff

Here is where I put anything remotely related to this class (and yes, this includes Homework 0, you're welcome graders).

### My favorite CS193 things

- The people (we unite as nerds, leave as nerds)
- The fact that PSOs are 100% optional and online
- The guides provided to programming resources are very useful
- We code. I like to code.

## About Me

Forget the class, this is MY page, and this part isn't getting graded so it's my time now.

### Who am I?

My name is Ellie Noh, I'm currently a freshman majoring in Computer Science at Purdue University. I also plan to minor in theater! When I'm not working or taking a well-deserved nap you can find me huddled up in my room playing video games, swimming, or singing and acting. I'm Korean-American and have lived in China, Singapore, and South Korea as well.

### Other things I do

As you could probably already tell, video games take up a huge part of my life, mostly story-based ones. The reason why I first wanted to learn how to code was so that I could make a video game and tell my own stories as well.

I used to competitively swim for about 11 years. It's still my favorite sport, and is the healthiest possible sport you can do. I will die on this hill, mark my words.

Singing is also simply a part of me: in choirs, theater, solo shows, or just on my own in the shower. I love singing.

At the same level, I have a great passion for acting and performing arts. In high school I worked on shows such as Guys and Dolls, the Addams Family, A Midsummer's Night Dream, and many more. I also did improv a lot as well. Outside of the stage, I also pursue voice acting online as a hobby, and it's one of the most fun activities ever.
